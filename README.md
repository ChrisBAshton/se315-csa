[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/ChrisBAshton/se315-csa.svg?token=HSfkP4Tffj4JT2ugyno9&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/ChrisBAshton/se315-csa)

Done:

- [x] Travis integration
- [x] Code coverage checker

Still on my TODO list:

- [ ] Test AJAX search using Jasmine
- [ ] Get latest Tweet after posting, to make sure it actually reaches Twitter
- [ ] Use the session optimiser from test/controllers/helper.rb for emulating sessions in Cucumber, rather than filling in forms and clicking 'Login'
- [ ] new.html.erb (and others) still has hardcoded English
- [ ] Wraith? (Screenshot comparison tests)
